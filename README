Comments
========

The idea is to have "comments contructor", a set of plugins to make comments exactly that you need with configuration as simple as posible.
Currently there are basic comments functionality without any plugin.
Controller extensions are currently missing in this repository.


Example
=======

In order to use this plugin you need also install "belongs_to_anything" and "hash4hash" plugins from my repositories

script/generate comments migration
rake db:migrate

Put next code snippet in ApplicationController

  before_filter :save_comment_if_there_is_one
  def save_comment_if_there_is_one
    if params[:comment]
      result = Comments::Manager::create_comment(params[:comment])
      redirect_to :back if result === true
      if result
        @comment = result
      end
    end
  end

If you want to have comments associated with some controller action simply put 
<%= display_comments %> somewhere on the page. 

You can also use comments with activerecord instances.

@article = Article.first

<%= comments_for @article %>
